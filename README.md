GitAICampusVerse is a one-day event to be organized in a university/college. During the event, students will learn the latest AI features of GitHub, Google, AWS, Microsoft, and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 

## Probable agenda:

**Note:** Depending on the university requirement, the agenda might change.
